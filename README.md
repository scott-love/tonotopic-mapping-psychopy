# tonotopic-mapping-psychopy
This code was created as part of the SheepVoicefMRI ANR project.

The code can be used with [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org).

The design of these experiments was heavily based on 
two papers by Langers and colleagues [1](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914006272) and [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914006259)
