# tonotopic-mapping-psychopy
This code was created as part of the [SheepVoicefMRI project](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-20-CE20-0001) funded by the ANR (ANR-20-CE20-0001).

The code can be used with [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org).

The design of these experiments was heavily based on 
two papers by Langers and colleagues (2014, [1](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914006272); [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914006259))
